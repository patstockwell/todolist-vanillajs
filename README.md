# To Do List App

An app built for the purposes of learning and understanding javascript apps without frameworks. The _redax.js_ file is (obviously) a simplified recreation of redux. The tests are written using [Michael Jackson's `expect` library](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) but are run in the browser console. Other than the `expect` library, there are zero dependencies for this project.
