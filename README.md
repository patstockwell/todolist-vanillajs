# To Do List App

An app built for the purposes of learning and understanding javascript apps without frameworks. The _redax.js_ file is a simplified recreation of redux. The tests are written using [Michael Jackson's `expect` library](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) and are simply run in the browser console. The `expect` library is a UMD module available as a global variable at runtime. There are zero dependencies for this project.
